## Description
We the NewCoders team got the problem statement that "Ahana's friends are fighting over dresses, They need help , hence she created a game to solve their problem".Our solution was that when any of her friends starts the game she gets to enter the size and occasion type,based on which she gets a dress of her size and occasion type automatically and the dress doesn't gets repeated for the same size( so you are uniqueüòÅ).We believe this is a problem which is faced by all women and needs to be solved in more efficient ways (to save time of getting readyüòâ. Our solution was pretty simple and so we would love to get new ideas for this project.
